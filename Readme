We tackled this task and found the top 5 most popular categories as asked, but 
we also went one step further.
- We found that animals and science are the two most popular categories, 
suggesting that users like "real-life" and "factual" content
- We also found that food was a common theme amongst popular content and 
the most popular food category was healthy eating. This could be a signal to 
show the types of people that are using your platform, and you could use this 
insight to boost engagement even further. For example, you could run a 
campaign with content focused on this category or work with healthy eating 
brands to promote content.
- As much as this analysis was insightful, we are ready to take it to the next 
stage and we have the expertise within Accenture to help you realize these 
kinds of insights in production across your organization and in real-time. We 
would love to help you with this.
